Shallow Copy : 

A shallow copy creates a new object which stores the reference of the original elements.

So, a shallow copy doesn't create a copy of nested objects, instead it just copies the reference of nested objects. This means, a copy process does not recurse or create copies of nested objects itself.


Deep Copy : 

A deep copy creates a new object and recursively adds the copies of nested objects present in the original elements.
